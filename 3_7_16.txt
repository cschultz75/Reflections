
Having issues with the overwhelming amount of syntax and remembering what it all means.
Understanding "void" vs "return" and what return actually does.
How to separate my Adventure class out into multiple classes.
Not knowing what "tool" to use as I am not aware of many of the tools or the syntax that represents them.
The structure of what goes where within the code.  Should it be chronological?
The "import" function and when to use it.

Unable to complete assignments without research and/or copying existing code and adjusting it.

So far being a developer seems tedious, to me at least, and requires more patience than I have.

I am really questioning if this is for me or not.
